### Description

Hey! It's my test assignment, and it could be better of course,
but I don't wanna spend the time on decoration and other stuff.
I could clean this code better, but unfortunately, I spend 3 hours just to
setup this project and made up it works with some UI libraries (it ended up refusing them because they don't work properly with Vue3 or Composition API).
So I could use Vuex instead of kinda provide/inject, but you wrote that I have to concentrate on performance and I don't think Vuex is the best solution for this.
Hope it'll work!
